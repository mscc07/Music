Welcome to LITESOPH's Documentation!
======================================
The LITESOPH project is aimed at developing a comprehensive toolkit to launch, monitor, manage and analyse large-scale simulations 
of photo-induced phenomena in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment. It is designed to serve the needs of computational
researchers interested in solar energy conversion applications (photovoltaics, water-splitting catalysts, solar fuels, etc.), 
opto-electronic materials, photochemistry and photobiology. The toolkit consists of several Python-based layers driven by 
popular and open-source TDDFT codes like OCTOPUS, GPAW and NWChem.

**LITESOPH** is the abriviated form of *Layer Integrated Toolkit and Engine for Simullations Of 
Photo-Induced Phenomena*.
It is a GUI-based software to perform the ground state DFT and TDDFT calculations 
using three engines : `GPAW <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/index.html>`_, `NWChem <https://nwchemgit.github.io/>`_ and 
`Octopus <https://octopus-code.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_ .
